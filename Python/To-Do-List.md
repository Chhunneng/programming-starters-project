# üìù To-Do List App in Python

Welcome to the **To-Do List App** project for Python! üêç  

In this project, we'll create a **command-line To-Do List** where users can **add, view, complete, and delete tasks**.  
This is a great beginner project for practicing **Python file handling, lists, functions, and user input**.

---

## Project Overview

### Objective
Create a Python script that implements a simple **To-Do List application** in the command line.

### Features
- ‚úÖ Add new tasks to the list  
- ‚úÖ View all tasks (pending and completed)  
- ‚úÖ Mark tasks as complete  
- ‚úÖ Delete tasks  
- ‚úÖ Save tasks to a file and load them on program start  

### Project Structure
Create a new Python script named `todo_list.py`.

## Instructions

1. **Load Tasks from File**  
   - At the start, read tasks from a file (if it exists) to maintain persistence.

2. **Display Menu**  
   - Show options like: `Add Task`, `View Tasks`, `Complete Task`, `Delete Task`, `Exit`.

3. **Add a Task**  
   - Prompt the user to enter a task description.  
   - Save it to the tasks list.

4. **View Tasks**  
   - Display all tasks with numbering.  
   - Optionally indicate which tasks are completed.

5. **Complete a Task**  
   - Ask the user for the task number to mark as complete.  
   - Update the status in the list.

6. **Delete a Task**  
   - Ask the user for the task number to delete.  
   - Remove it from the list.

7. **Save Tasks to File**  
   - After each modification, save the current tasks list to a file for persistence.

8. **Exit Program**  
   - End the program when the user chooses to exit.

## Example Code

```python
import os

# File to store tasks
TASKS_FILE = "tasks.txt"

# Load tasks from file
def load_tasks():
    tasks = []
    if os.path.exists(TASKS_FILE):
        with open(TASKS_FILE, "r") as f:
            for line in f:
                description, status = line.strip().split("|")
                tasks.append({"description": description, "completed": status=="True"})
    return tasks

# Save tasks to file
def save_tasks(tasks):
    with open(TASKS_FILE, "w") as f:
        for task in tasks:
            f.write(f"{task['description']}|{task['completed']}\n")

# Display tasks
def view_tasks(tasks):
    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks found.")
        return
    for idx, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
        status = "‚úì" if task["completed"] else "‚úó"
        print(f"{idx}. [{status}] {task['description']}")

# Add a new task
def add_task(tasks):
    description = input("Enter the task description: ")
    tasks.append({"description": description, "completed": False})
    save_tasks(tasks)
    print("Task added successfully.")

# Complete a task
def complete_task(tasks):
    view_tasks(tasks)
    number = int(input("Enter the task number to mark as complete: "))
    if 0 < number <= len(tasks):
        tasks[number-1]["completed"] = True
        save_tasks(tasks)
        print("Task marked as complete.")
    else:
        print("Invalid task number.")

# Delete a task
def delete_task(tasks):
    view_tasks(tasks)
    number = int(input("Enter the task number to delete: "))
    if 0 < number <= len(tasks):
        removed = tasks.pop(number-1)
        save_tasks(tasks)
        print(f"Task '{removed['description']}' deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print("Invalid task number.")

# Main program
def main():
    tasks = load_tasks()
    while True:
        print("\n--- To-Do List Menu ---")
        print("1. View Tasks")
        print("2. Add Task")
        print("3. Complete Task")
        print("4. Delete Task")
        print("5. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            view_tasks(tasks)
        elif choice == "2":
            add_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "3":
            complete_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "4":
            delete_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "5":
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

## Code Explanation

1Ô∏è‚É£ File Handling
Load tasks from a file at the start to maintain persistence.
Save tasks after every modification (add, complete, delete).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Task Management
Tasks are stored as dictionaries with description and completed status.
Functions like add_task, complete_task, delete_task, and view_tasks handle all operations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Menu System
A loop displays options to the user.
User input directs to the corresponding function.
Program continues until the user selects Exit.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Task Status
‚úì indicates completed tasks
‚úó indicates pending tasks
